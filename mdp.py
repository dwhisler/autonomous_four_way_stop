    #   -- If the player's last action was to peek, the second element is the index

    #      second element is None.

    # A few reminders:
    # * Indicate a terminal state (after quitting, busting, or running out of cards)
    #   by setting the deck to None.
    # * If |state| is an end state, you should return an empty list [].
    # * When the probability is 0 for a transition to a particular new state,
    #   don't include that state in the list returned by succAndProbReward.
    # Note: The grader expects the outputs follow the same order as the cards.
    # For example, if the deck has face values: 1, 2, 3. You should order your corresponding
    # tuples in the same order.
